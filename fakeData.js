Watch for wildlife throughout your hike, as bears, mountain goats, hoary marmots, and others, have all been seen from the trail. </p> <p><strong>Be prepared!</strong> Check on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kefj/planyourvisit/conditions.htm\">trail conditions</a> before starting out - the upper portion of the trail is often covered with snow through early July, and there may be avalanche danger. Be prepared for storms, high winds, intense sunlight, and sudden temperature changes. Bring warm clothes, rain gear, sturdy footwear, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Carry plenty of water (at least 2 liters per person).</p> <p><strong>Stay on the trail.</strong> Alpine vegetation is extremely fragile. Careless hikers who cut switchbacks, along with frequent summer rains, cause tremendous erosion. Volunteers help restore and maintain this trail every year. Please respect their hard work by sticking to the trail.</p>",
